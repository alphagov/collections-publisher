# Collections Publisher

The Collections Publisher publishes:

- [/browse pages](https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages/register-offices)
- [/topic pages](https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-enterprise/export-finance)
- [step by step pages](https://www.gov.uk/learn-to-drive-a-car) and [step by step sidebar navigation](https://www.gov.uk/driving-eyesight-rules)

These pages are then served by the [collections app](https://github.com/alphagov/collections).

## Technical documentation

This is a Ruby on Rails application for internal use by GDS and some departmental editors.

It has these features:

- Creating & editing topics and mainstream browse pages.
- Creating & editing step by step navigation pages, and where they are used as sidebar and sticky navigation.
- Curate the pages tagged to a topic or browse page into "curated lists". This means they'll be displayed in a group with a title. By default, the links are not curated and will appear with a 'A-Z' heading.
- [Curating, and editing coronavirus pages](docs/coronavirus_page_publishing_tool.md).

This application uses the [sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org/) message queue for background work (mainly publishing to the Publishing API).

### Dependencies

- [alphagov/publishing-api](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api) -
  - used for the publishing workflow of `mainstream_browse_page`s, `topic`s, curated lists and `step_by_step_page`s.
  - Publishing API sends data onto [Rummager](https://github.com/alphagov/rummager) for search indexing `topic`, `mainstream_browse_page` and `step_by_step_page` pages.

### Running the test suite

The test suite includes testing against
[govuk-content-schemas](http://github.com/alphagov/govuk-content-schemas), so
you will need a copy of this repo on your file system. By default this should
be in a sibling directory to your project. Alternatively, you can specify their
location with the `GOVUK_CONTENT_SCHEMAS_PATH` environment variable.

To run the test suite:

```
bundle exec rake
```

          Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.
          Use non-bulleted lists for tasks. Add any costs after the link:

           [task name](/link) £10 to £20
           [task name](/link)

          Only use bullets to show when a task has a number of options to choose from:

          - [download form option 1](/link)
          - [download form option 2](/link)
          - bullet with no links
  step_by_step_pages:
    form:
      title:
        label: Title
        guidance: "Add step by step after your title unless it will be inappropriate or make the title excessively long. Keep it under 85 characters"
      slug:
        label: Slug
        guidance: "Slug is the link for your step by step. It should be lowercase and you should use hyphens to separate words. For example: get-driving-license"
      introduction:
        label: Introduction
        guidance: "The introduction explains what the step by step helps the user do, or what it is. Keep it short. Tell users if it is not relevant to them. Do not include any important information in here that doesn’t exist elsewhere."
      meta_description:
        label: Meta description
        guidance: "Meta description is shown in the GOV.UK search results. It should explain what the step by step helps the user do, or what it is. Keep it under 160 characters."
    step:
      title:
        label: Step title
        guidance: "Step title should start with a verb. For example: 'Check you're eligible'"
      step_label:
        label: Step label
        number:
          label: number
          hint: "Use ‘number’ to show order of the steps"
        and:
          label: and
          hint: "Use ‘and’ to show when you can (or need) to complete more than one step simultaneously."
        or:
          label: or
          hint: "Use ‘or’ to show when there is an alternative way to complete a step or task."
      view_broken_links: "View broken links"
      content:
        label: "Content, tasks and links"
        guidance_title: "Describing a step"
        guidance: |
          A step can be a task or a group of related tasks. A task is an action the user needs to do, for example Check if you need to apply for a licence. Link the whole sentence - not just the action - and do not add a full stop.

          Start a step with an action and explain the context in the link where possible, for example ‘Check what age you can drive’. Keep it short.

          [The content patterns guidance](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages/416317515/Step+and+task+content+patterns)

          ### Formatting

          Links should be task focused. You cannot link only part of a sentence.

          `[Task name](/link)`

          For example: `[book your theory test](/book-theory-test)`

          Only use bullets to show different ways you can perform the same task or different variables that change how you complete the task. Do not use bullets to list tasks that are all essential

          `- [download option 1](/link)`
          `- [download option 2](/link)`

    guidance_markdown: |
      ##What is secondary content?

      Secondary content is content which is not linked to in the step by step, but has the step by step sidebar showing on it.

      We use it for content which:

      - could help you complete a task but is not the main piece of content included in the step by step
      - is optional and not useful enough to be included in the step by step
    index:
      base_path:
        label: Add new secondary link
        hint: "For example: https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat or /bank-holidays"

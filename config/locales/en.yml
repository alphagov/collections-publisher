          #### Describing a step

          A step can be a task or a group of related tasks. A task is an action the user needs to do, for example Check if you need to apply for a licence. Link the whole sentence - not just the action - and do not add a full stop.

          Start a step with an action and keep it short, for example ‘Check what age you can drive’.

          [The content patterns guidance](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages/416317515/Step+and+task+content+patterns)

          #### Formatting

          Links should be task focused. You cannot link only part of a sentence.

          `[Task name](/link)`

          For example: `[book your theory test](/book-theory-test)`

          Only use bullets to show different ways you can perform the same task or different variables that change how you complete the task. Do not use bullets to list tasks that are all essential

          `- [download option 1](/link)`

          `- [download option 2](/link)`
    reorder:
      header: Order of steps
      order:
        Steps and tasks should be listed in the order in which users need to complete them.
    sidebar_settings:
      header: Sidebar settings
      guidance_markdown: |
        ### Always show navigation

        Sidebar will always show on the piece of content. Choose this option if the content is about a task that is always completed as part of the step by step journey. For example, booking a theory driving test is always part of the wider journey of learning to drive.

        ### Show navigation if users comes from step by step

        Sidebar will only show if you clicked on a link in the step by step to get there For example: If the page is part of multiple user journeys and showing step by steps risks limiting the way the page is used'.

        ### Never show navigation

        Chose this option when you're linking to a page that it would never be appropriate for the step by step side bar to appear on.
    secondary_content_links:
      header: Secondary links
      guidance_markdown: |
        Secondary content is content which is not linked to in the step by step, but has the step by step sidebar showing on it.

        We use it for content which:

          - could help you complete a task but is not the main piece of content included in the step by step.
          - is optional and not useful enough to be included in the step by step
    summary_page:
      sidebar_settings: Choose to hide the sidebar on certain pages.
      secondary_links: Choose additional pages to show the step by step sidebar.
      tags: Tag the step by step to the GOV.UK taxonomy and mainstream browse pages.

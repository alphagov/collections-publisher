name: Markdown editor
description: Allows editing markdown within a textarea
body: |
  This component is branched from the [markdown_editor component in Content Publisher](https://content-publisher.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/component-guide/markdown_editor)
  and it relies on the [markdown-toolbar-element](https://github.com/alphagov/markdown-toolbar-element).
  It must always have an `id` attribute defined for the textarea element (as shown in the example below) as it's required
  to bind the textarea with the label and the markdown toolbar.
